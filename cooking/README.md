I like to cook without a recipe book in hand or a youtube video on swift play/pause. I want healthy, great tasting food in the shortest possible time. I have a busy schedule but good food is not only healthy, it is also lighter on the pocket if you plan it well. My projected savings are in the range of ₹40 - ₹65K ($552 - $897) annully (compared to ordering food), and lost 3% body fat within a week.

This section is devoted to failures and recipes that I discover in the process.

Images and recipes of practice work. More focus on failures.
